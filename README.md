Trade off uses GP models to analyze the benefits and drawbacks to gas-powered 
and soalr-electric powered long endurance aircraft.  A simple model is made of 
both the gas and solar-electirc powered aircraft to understand the design space.  
Detailed structural models are also added to improve the accuracy of the results.

\chapter{Discussion on the use of the \emph{JH01} airfoil} 

The \emph{sd7032} airfoil was redesigned to prevent drag creep by weakening the pressure spike associated with premature separation at higher Reynolds numbers.  
Figure~\ref{f:jhcps} shows the pressure distributions generated in XFOIL of the \emph{JH01} airfoil at $C_L=0.0$ and $C_L=1.35$ with $Re=\num{3d5}$.
The redesigned airfoil was named \emph{JH01}. We would like to thank Mark Drela for the redesign.

\chapter{Conclusion}
Using geometric programming the feasibility limits of solar-electric and gas powered aircraft were analyzed to a level of detail and speed not previously achieved in conceptual sizing studies. 
Based on the assumptions included herein, the gas powered aircraft is more capable of meeting high latitude and station keeping requirements. 
The solar-electric powered aircraft sizing does not converge at latitude requirements above 31 degrees latitude. 
However, solar-electric powered aircraft can meet high endurance and altitude requirements.  
The effect of key design parameters on the size of each architecture were also quantified.  
Using higher energy density batteries can result in significant weight and performance savings for the solar-electric powered aircraft.
